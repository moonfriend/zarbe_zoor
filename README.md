Zarbe Zoor is a helper app for the Pahlavani sport (also branded as Persian Yoga)

This usually includes a percussionist (known as Morshed) who also coaches the trainees 
during the session. However many gyms nowadays, especially outside of Iran do not have 
access to a Morshed. This app is trying to fill this gap and act as an E-Morshed.
